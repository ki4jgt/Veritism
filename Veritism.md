# An Open Source Religion

Veritism (Latin for Truth) is an open source religion, which unlike others, welcomes revision as one's understanding progresses. Being open source, the text naturally is bound to a versioning system. The strength in religion is its ability to collect and distill fragments of wisdom over generations. The gift of religion is the ability for a diaspora to remember.

Various iterations of this document will undoubtedly arise, containing biases and bigoted opinions throughout its evolution. Lies will be amended, truths will be redacted. Versioning this text allows a historical revisiting to better comprehend what we may have lost along the way.

Veritism is, above all, the search for -- not the knowing of -- Truth.

## Preface

My journey with this concept started with a simple premise: In a universe of lies, the truth is everywhere! The bad and the good, it's all Truth. We're connected to it all.

Truth cannot be altered or changed -- not even by a god. It cannot be concealed, as everything affects every other thing. Therefore, it is all-powerful. Neither your most distant enemies, nor your closest friends can overpower Truth.

It is all knowing. Any event throughout time is as real ten thousand years before it occurs as it is ten thousand after. The death of a loved one is as real ten thousand years ago as it will be ten thousand years from now. And because it is all-knowing, it is also all-present. It was here before our universe, and will be here infinitely after our last star goes cold.

The past can affect the future, but the future can affect the past too. When anticipating a party, do you not make preparations? Truth has always been, and always will be.

As every action requires an equal and opposite reaction, the entire multiverse pushes down on every single quark. Nay, every single idea. Ideas affect the physical through their hosts. Concepts such as ownership and personhood have physical effects in the real world. The physical and the metaphysical must in turn, exert back just as much to even have the right to exist.

Further, Truth is both infinitely receptive and infinitely assertive. In as much as it cannot be moved, it allows infinite potential to exist throughout itself.

It builds up to its highest self by the convergence of its smallest selves, all parts pre-existing before their own conception. All stations integral to the formation of the whole. And the whole indebted to all the stations below it. Neither can exist without the other. All, the individual parts and the combined whole, is Truth.

Conceptually, I support the notion that Truth is all-knowing, in that emptiness has mechanical applications. Cogs and guns have no use without emptiness. Neither do keyboards. A footprint in the sand is empty. To create a cast, one need only pour in a mold. The forces we exert in reality create mechanical counter-forces. Leading to mirror worlds at every single point of Truth. These worlds are all around us, and we move in and out of them at will, when Schrodinger's box opens.

## The Eternal Truth
The parts are no greater than the sum.
The sum is no greater than its parts.
All things are equal, when,
For every action,
There is an equal and opposite reaction.

Dimensions unfold.
Potential untold.
When in the reflection of Truth.
Is Truth.

## Remembering Who You Are
I summon Truth as a source of strength.
To be a voice of refuge in my universe of lies.
